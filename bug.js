In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an uncommon error arises when the `renderItem` function tries to access data that doesn't exist. This might occur if the data source is asynchronous and the `renderItem` is called before the data is fully fetched or if there is a mismatch in data indices.  The symptoms might include blank cells, crashes, or unexpected behavior. For example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={this.state.myData}
  renderItem={({item, index}) => (
    <Text>{item.name}</Text> // Crashes if item is undefined
  )}
/>
```
